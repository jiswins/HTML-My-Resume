<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>During my free time, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar. Graphic Design, illustration, painting, reading, watching movies, and going out with friends at the weekend are some of my hobbies. My musical interests include piano, guitar, and singing. I am interested in learning more about the present trends in creative arts because it is likely to play a major role in the world of tomorrow regarding design concepts.</p>
